  declarations = NULL,

  html_deps = NULL,
  file_attachments = character(0),
  tags = character(0)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{A collection of \code{\link[=sass_layer]{sass_layer()}}s and/or objects that \code{\link[=as_sass]{as_sass()}}
understands. Arguments should be provided in reverse priority order:
defaults, declarations, and rules in later layers will take precedence over
those of previous layers. Non-layer values will be converted to layers by
calling \code{sass_layer(rules = ...)}.}

\item{defaults}{A suitable \code{\link[=as_sass]{as_sass()}} \code{input}. Intended for declaring
variables with \code{!default}. When layers are combined, defaults are merged in
reverse order; that is, \code{sass_layer_merge(layer1, layer2)} will include
\code{layer2$defaults} before \code{layer1$defaults}.}

\item{declarations}{A suitable \code{\link[=as_sass]{as_sass()}} \code{input}.  Intended for
function and mixin declarations, and variable declarations without
\code{!default}; not intended for actual CSS rules. These will be merged in
forward order; that is, \code{sass_layer_merge(layer1, layer2)} will include
\code{layer1$declarations} before \code{layer2$declarations}.}

\item{rules}{A suitable \code{\link[=as_sass]{as_sass()}} \code{input}. Intended for actual CSS
rules. These will be merged in forward order; that is,
\code{sass_layer_merge(layer1, layer2)} will include \code{layer1$rules} before
\code{layer2$rules}.}

\item{html_deps}{An HTML dependency (or a list of them).}

\item{file_attachments}{A named character vector, representing file assets
that are referenced (using relative paths) from the sass in this layer. The
vector names should be a relative path, and the corresponding vector values
should be absolute paths to files or directories that exist; at render
time, each value will be copied to the relative path indicated by its name.
(For directories, the \emph{contents} of the source directory will be copied
into the destination directory; the directory itself will not be copied.)
You can also omit the name, in which case that file or directory will be
copied directly into the output directory.}

\item{tags}{A character vector with zero or more elements. Can be used to
preserve simple metadata as layers are merged.}
}
\description{
Sass layers are a way to group a set of related Sass variable definitions,
function/mixin declarations, and CSS rules into a single object. Use
\code{sass_layer()} to create these objects, and \code{sass_layer_merge()} to combine
two or more layer objects into a single layer; this ability to be merged is
the main benefit of using Sass layers versus lower-level forms of sass input.

\examples{
blue <- list(color = "blue !default")
red <- list(color = "red !default")
green <- list(color = "green !default")

# a sass_layer() by itself is not very useful, it just defines some
# SASS to place before (defaults) and after (declarations, rules)
core <- sass_layer(defaults = blue, rules = "body { color: $color; }")
core
sass(core)

# However, by stacking sass_layer()s, we have ability to place
# SASS both before and after some other sass (e.g., core)
# Here we place a red default _before_ the blue default and export the
# color SASS variable as a CSS variable _after_ the core
red_layer <- sass_layer(red, rules = ":root{ --color: #{$color}; }")
sass(sass_layer_merge(core, red_layer))
sass(sass_layer_merge(core, red_layer, sass_layer(green)))
