\usage{
sass(
  input = NULL,
  options = sass_options(),
  output = NULL,
  write_attachments = NA,
  cache = sass_cache_get(),
  cache_key_extra = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Accepts raw Sass, a named list of variables, a list of raw Sass
and/or named variables, or a \code{\link[=sass_layer]{sass_layer()}} object. See \code{\link[=as_sass]{as_sass()}} and
\code{\link[=sass_import]{sass_import()}} / \code{\link[=sass_file]{sass_file()}} for more details.}

\item{options}{Compiler options for Sass. Please specify options using
\code{\link[=sass_options]{sass_options()}}.}

\item{output}{Specifies path to output file for compiled CSS. May be a
character string or \code{\link[=output_template]{output_template()}}}

\item{write_attachments}{If the input contains \code{\link[=sass_layer]{sass_layer()}} objects that
have file attachments, and \code{output} is not \code{NULL}, then copy the file
attachments to the directory of \code{output}. (Defaults to \code{NA}, which merely
emits a warning if file attachments are present, but does not write them to
disk; the side-effect of writing extra files is subtle and potentially
destructive, as files may be overwritten.)}

\item{cache}{This can be a directory to use for the cache, a \link{FileCache}
object created by \code{\link[=sass_file_cache]{sass_file_cache()}}, or \code{FALSE} or \code{NULL} for no caching.}

\item{cache_key_extra}{additional information to considering when computing
the cache key. This should include any information that could possibly
influence the resulting CSS that isn't already captured by \code{input}. For
example, if \code{input} contains something like \code{"@import sass_file.scss"} you
may want to include the \code{\link[=file.mtime]{file.mtime()}} of \code{sass_file.scss} (or, perhaps, a
\code{\link[=packageVersion]{packageVersion()}} if \code{sass_file.scss} is bundled with an R package).}
}
\value{
If \code{output = NULL}, the function returns a string value of the
compiled CSS. If \code{output} is specified, the compiled CSS is written to a
file and the filename is returned.

\section{Caching}{


By default, caching is enabled, meaning that \code{sass()} avoids the possibly
expensive re-compilation of CSS whenever the same \code{options} and \code{input} are
requested. Unfortunately, in some cases, \code{options} and \code{input} alone aren't
enough to determine whether new CSS output must be generated. For example,
changes in local file
\href{https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import}{imports} that aren't
captured through \code{\link[=sass_file]{sass_file()}}/\code{\link[=sass_import]{sass_import()}}, may lead to a
false-positive cache hit. For this reason, developers are encouraged to
capture such information in \code{cache_key_extra} (possibly with
\code{packageVersion('myPackage')} if shipping Sass with a package), and users
may want to disable caching altogether during local development by calling
\code{options(sass.cache=FALSE)}.

In some cases when developing and modifying .scss files, \code{\link[=sass]{sass()}} might not
detect changes, and keep using cached .css files instead of rebuilding
them. To be safe, if you are developing a theme with sass, it's best to
turn off caching by calling \code{options(sass.cache=FALSE)}.

If caching is enabled, \code{\link[=sass]{sass()}} will attempt to bypass the compilation
process by reusing output from previous \code{\link[=sass]{sass()}} calls that used equivalent
inputs. This mechanism works by computing a \emph{cache key} from each \code{\link[=sass]{sass()}}
call's \code{input}, \code{option}, and \code{cache_key_extra} arguments. If an object
with that hash already exists within the cache directory, its contents are
used instead of performing the compilation. If it does not exist, then
compilation is performed and usual and the results are stored in the cache.

If a file that is included using \code{\link[=sass_file]{sass_file()}} changes on disk (i.e. its
last-modified time changes), its previous cache entries will effectively be
invalidated (not removed from disk, but they'll no longer be matched).
However, if a file imported using \code{\link[=sass_file]{sass_file()}} itself imports other sass
files using \code{@import}, changes to those files are invisible to the
cache and you can end up with stale results. To avoid this problem when
developing sass code, it's best to disable caching with
\code{options(sass.cache=FALSE)}.

By default, the maximum size of the cache is 40 MB. If it grows past that
size, the least-recently-used objects will be evicted from the cache to
keep it under that size. Also by default, the maximum age of objects in the
cache is one week. Older objects will be evicted from the cache.

To clear the default cache, call \code{sass_cache_get()$reset()}.
